## Installation
1. Donwload and Configure C++/GCC from https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp.
2. Download and Configure StartUML (optional) if you want to open/modify the UML file: https://staruml.io/
3. Download or clone this repository in your folder:
```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/luisfelipe7/CPP-Review-With-GCC-StartUML
```
4. Go into to the repository
```bash
# Go into the repository
$ cd CPP-Review-With-GCC-StartUML
```

## Run it
1. Compile the file Main.cpp with GCC compiler.
```bash
# Run in bash
$ g++ Main.cpp
```
2. Then execute the .exe file and start checking the options that I have to test and pratice.
3. Open the file called "UML Diagram - StarUML.mdj" using StarUML if you want to modify the file.

## Structure
1. The Header files are located in the folder called Header Files.
2. The Definition files are located in the folder called Definition Files.
3. The Main.cpp file is the one in charge of running the program and including the classes to compile the files.
4. Finally, these are the principal relations between the classes:

<h6>*Some of the constructors are not showing all the parameters and some classes are not including all the methods, the idea of the UML was to define the relations between the classes</h6>
